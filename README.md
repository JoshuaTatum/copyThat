# copyThat

jQuery implementation of popular "Copy That" meme. Activated with Ctrl+C or right-click menu.

Simply add, "<script type="text/javascript" src="copyThat-jquery-1.0.js"></script>" to "<head>" tag.

You may have to change the paths in the JS file if you move either the audio files or cursor outside of rsc/.

Open 'demo.html' to see it in action.

Don't take this too seriously. Took like an hour to put together. Will add .ogg, .cur, and .ico support if interest is shown.
I don't see anybody realistically implementing this onto their site, don't worry.
See, http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copy-that for reference.
